# Quantum Federated Learning for Healthcare Diagnostics

## Overview
This project implements a federated learning model with quantum-enhanced algorithms for predictive diagnostics in healthcare.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for data preparation, model training, and deployment.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment.
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preparation.py
   ```
2. Train the federated learning model:
   ```bash
   python src/federated_learning.py
   ```
3. Train the quantum model:
   ```bash
   python src/quantum_model.py
   ```
4. Start the API for predictions:
   ```bash
   python src/deployment.py
   ```
